# Plotting traffic camera locations in Hong Kong with GeoPandas

This project contains a [Jupyter notebook](Traffic%20Cameras%20-%20GeoPandas.ipynb) that explains how to use [GeoPandas](http://geopandas.org/) to visualise locations on a map, in this case the locations of traffic cameras in Hong Kong.

The project makes use of traffic camera location data sourced from [here](https://data.gov.hk/en-data/dataset/hk-td-tis_2-traffic-snapshot-images/resource/338f29cd-cefc-49b9-b2d2-2894cb28953f), together with a shapefile of Hong Kong's 18 districts sourced from [here](http://opendata.esrichina.hk/datasets/eea8ff2f12b145f7b33c4eef4f045513_0). (Note that the traffic camera data is from the same dataset I used to create [this](https://rmlowe.github.io/traffic-images/).)
